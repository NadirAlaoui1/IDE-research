## **IntelliJ Idea**

1. *Pros*
* Works with many languages
* One of the best code debuggers
* Handles basic syntax errors

2. *Cons*
 * For more features you have to buy the license
 * Not ligtweight (requires a good amount of RAM and processing power)
 * A lot of options and modifications that make it seem endless
 
- Reason I chose this IDE
   
I like programs that are challenging to learn, but pay off once you get the hang of it

Let's compare it to to Android Studio

InteliJ IDEA | Android Studio
------------ | --------------
easy to use for almost everything | exclusively made for android
Not lightweight nor heavyweight | heavyweight
Steep learning curve | easy to learn
